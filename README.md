# A gentle introduction

Please kindly download my repository, unzip, and run the main file, titled: **Main_Server_Dev.py**

One runs it successfully, a Index page appears to give a gentle introduction to the fundamental feature of my Flask server.
I hope you have a great time and thank you so much for evaluating my Flask server.
